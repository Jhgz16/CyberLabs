  { text: 'You see a code "SGVsbG8=". What is it?', options: ['Base64', 'AES', 'MD5'], correctAnswer: 'Base64', difficulty: 'Medium', explanation: 'Decodes to "Hello". Base64 is common for encoding data.' },
  { text: 'A file uses key "secret" for encryption. What type?', options: ['Symmetric', 'Asymmetric', 'Hash'], correctAnswer: 'Symmetric', difficulty: 'Medium', explanation: 'A single key suggests symmetric encryption (e.g., AES). Use a strong key.' },
  { text: 'A hash is "e80b5017098950fc58aad83c8c14978e". What type?', options: ['MD5', 'SHA-1', 'SHA-256'], correctAnswer: 'MD5', difficulty: 'Highly Technical', explanation: 'This 32-character hash is MD5. It’s weak; use SHA-256.' },
  { text: 'A cipher shifts "HI" to "KL". What is it?', options: ['Caesar', 'Vigenère', 'AES'], correctAnswer: 'Caesar', difficulty: 'Medium', explanation: 'A shift of 2 (H->K, I->L) is a Caesar cipher. Break it with frequency analysis.' },
  { text: 'A site’s private RSA key is leaked. What to do?', options: ['Nothing', 'New keys', 'Reset site'], correctAnswer: 'New keys', difficulty: 'Highly Technical', explanation: 'A leaked key compromises security. Generate new RSA keys.' },
  { text: 'A password is hashed as "pass123". Is this secure?', options: ['Yes', 'No', 'Maybe'], correctAnswer: 'No', difficulty: 'Medium', explanation: 'Plaintext hashing is insecure. Use bcrypt with a salt.' },
  { text: 'You see "U2FsdGVkX18". What encryption?', options: ['Base64', 'AES', 'RSA'], correctAnswer: 'AES', difficulty: 'Highly Technical', explanation: 'This is AES (OpenSSL format). Decrypt with the correct key.' },
  { text: 'A message "WKH" decodes to "THE". What cipher?', options: ['Caesar', 'Substitution', 'ROT13'], correctAnswer: 'Caesar', difficulty: 'Highly Technical', explanation: 'A shift of 3 (W->T, K->H, H->E) is Caesar. Analyze shifts to decode.' },
  { text: 'A site uses TLS 1.1. Is it secure?', options: ['Yes', 'No', 'Maybe'], correctAnswer: 'No', difficulty: 'Medium', explanation: 'TLS 1.1 is outdated. Upgrade to TLS 1.3 for security.' },
  { text: 'A 64-bit key encrypts a file. Is it safe?', options: ['Yes', 'No', 'Maybe'], correctAnswer: 'No', difficulty: 'Highly Technical', explanation: '64-bit keys (e.g., DES) are weak. Use 256-bit keys like AES-256.' }
